# Rigid body dynamics engine with an integrated path tracer

### Controls:

- Hold right mouse button to pan the camera, and WASD to move around the scene.
- 'M' throws a sphere.
- 'P' toggles the physics simulation (basically a pause button).
- 'R' starts a new path-tracing render (in Visual Studio only).
